### Overview

* Crystal Collectors is a game designed to reinforce javascript and introduce jQuery.
* The objective here is to generate a random number to target, then assign randomized values to individual buttons (crystals) for each round of play.
* Once those values are assigned, the user will be able to see values added to a total score as each button is clicked.
* The goal is to hit the target number using a combination of the values assigned to the crystals.
